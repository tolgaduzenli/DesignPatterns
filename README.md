Practice of Design Patterns from Head First (Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra)

    Chapter 1 Contains
        Object Oriented Basics
            * Abstraction
            * Encapsulation
            * Inheritance
            * Polymorphism
        Object Oriented Principles
            * Encapsulate what varies
            * Favor composition over inheritance
            * Program to interface not an implementation
        Object Oriented Patterns
            * Strategy Pattern : define a family of algorthms, encapsulate each one, and makes them interchangeable.
              Strategy lets the algorithm vary independetly from client that use it.

        OO Principles
            * Strive for loosly coupled designs between objects that interact.
        OO Patterns
            * Observer defines a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its
            dependents are notified and update automaticly.
    Chapter 3 Contains
        OO Principles
            * Class should be open for extension but closed for modification. Open Close Principle.
        OO Patterns
            * Attached additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality.
